## Mechanism

- eleman at commit `66bd1af` (https://github.com/akadal/eleman), software DOI
  10.5281/zenodo.23975338. This repository was generated from that template; the deviations are
  listed in `dataset/DESIGN.md`. The mechanism is not updated during the run.

## Mailbox

Rule (fixed before looking at mailbox content): at least 3,000 unique messages after
de-duplication, at least 25% sent by the owner, a span of at least 24 months; among those, the
mailbox with the most unique messages under 15,000, so that a full run stays affordable. All 150
CMU mailboxes appear in EnronQA (Ryan et al., 2025, arXiv:2505.00263), whose records carry the
CMU path, so EnronQA questions can be mapped onto this stream.

15 of 150 mailboxes met the thresholds (`dataset/mailbox-stats.csv`, from `build_stream.py stats`). The largest, `dasovich-j` (15,876 unique), is over the
cap; the rule selects **`kaminski-v`**:

| | |
|---|---|
| files in the mailbox | 28,465 |
| unique messages | 11,523 |
| dropped for impossible dates | 26 |
| sent by the owner | 49.4% (5,689) |
| first / last message | 1999-11-30 / 2002-02-03 |
| owner addresses (checked by hand, below) | 8 |
| time zones in Date headers | -0800 (5,588), -0700 (5,935): US Pacific, so local order equals UTC order |
| stream checksum (`kaminski-v.jsonl`) | built twice, byte-identical |

## Owner addresses

The first build took the owner's addresses from the sent folders and labelled 501 of the owner's
own messages "received": the personal AOL account and the Outlook-era `kaminski@enron.com`. Both
were checked by reading samples (the messages are signed "Vince", grade the owner's Rice
students, and forward to the work account). The list now used, in `build_stream.py`:

`vince.kaminski@enron.com` (3,958 messages), `j.kaminski@enron.com` (1,222),
`vkaminski@aol.com` (251), `kaminski@enron.com` (250), `j..kaminski@enron.com` (4),
`vince.j.kaminski@enron.com` (2), `vkamins@ect.enron.com` (1), `vkaminski@palm.net` (1).

`vincek@stanford.edu` (two messages, display name "Vince Kaminski") is a different person and is
not an owner address.

## Stream facts

- 23.5% of all body characters repeat, line by line, text that appeared in an earlier message
  (reply chains and forwards, by the rules in `dataset/DESIGN.md`); 4,156 messages quote at least
  one earlier message.
- 437 messages repeat another message's body exactly; 635 are tagged bulk; 6,292 threads, the
  largest 193 messages.
- (The first description reported 32.5%, 7,745 and 2,312: its rules counted single recurring
  header lines as quotes. See `dataset/audit/2026-11-13-4-pilot-review.md`.)
- Longest body 107,183 characters; 99th percentile 11,981. Nothing is capped anywhere.
- No body contains `(sleep-task)`, `(feedback)` or a `memory/...md` path.
